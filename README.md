# Product-and-Sales-Analysis-for-Retail-Store

## Executive Summary:

Sales performance across our product portfolio has reached $4.59M, with over 75,000 units sold and 5,010 orders processed. However, our profit margin remains modest at 12.47%, indicating potential inefficiencies in conversion and pricing strategy. Using Power BI, I developed a comprehensive dashboard to track product performance, regional trends, and category-level insights.

The analysis revealed that our largest revenue opportunities lie in:

•	Increasing conversion rates in underperforming regions (e.g., Central and Texas)

•	Optimizing product mix to favor high-margin items

•	Enhancing engagement with top-selling categories like Technology and Furniture


To improve conversion and profitability, I recommend the following product and sales adjustments:
1.	Refine product descriptions and visuals to boost engagement
2.	Launch geo-targeted campaigns in low-performing regions
3.	Introduce reminder emails/texts for abandoned carts and incomplete orders
4.	Strengthen client relationships through bundled offers and loyalty incentives
   
### Business Problem:

Completed orders are the backbone of our revenue model, yet conversion rates remain below expectations. While California and the West region dominate sales, Central and Southern states like Texas show significant drop-off between product views and completed purchases.

The challenge:

How can we identify where users disengage in the sales funnel and implement product-level changes that drive completion?

By analyzing category performance, regional breakdowns, and seasonal trends, we can pinpoint friction points and deploy targeted interventions from UX copy changes to strategic promotions that turn interest into revenue.

### Methodology

To understand sales performance and identify conversion gaps, I used Excel to extract, clean, and transform product order data from the database. I built a Power BI dashboard to visualize order volume, category breakdowns, regional performance, and product-level trends. It was also used to run funnel simulations and model the impact of potential changes on revenue.

### Tools and Skills

•	Power BI: DAX, calculated columns, ETL processes, data modeling, and interactive visualizations

### Results and Business Recommendation

The dashboard provided product and sales stakeholders with real-time visibility into order performance across categories and regions. 

Key findings from the analysis include:

•	California and the West region lead in sales, while Texas and the Central region show lower conversion rates

•	Technology products account for 36.4% of total sales, but accessories offer higher margins and upsell potential

•	Nearly half of potential orders drop off before entering the workflow

•	Seasonal trends suggest strong Q4 performance and mid-year slowdowns

Using simulations, we found that:

•	A 10% increase in user interaction could generate approximately $2,850 in additional daily revenue

•	A 10% increase in completed purchase attempts could add around $4,050 in daily revenue

To improve conversion and profitability, I recommend:
1.	Updating product visuals and descriptions to increase engagement
2.	Launching reminder emails and texts for incomplete orders
3.	Running geo-targeted campaigns in underperforming regions
4.	Promoting bundled offers and loyalty incentives for high-margin products
   
I believe these adjustments directly address the most critical drop-off points in our product funnel, especially in underperforming regions and categories. By refining product visuals, launching targeted campaigns, and improving client engagement, we can increase conversion rates, drive incremental revenue, and reduce workload.

### Next Steps
1.	Run A/B tests on product descriptions and visuals to boost user interaction
2.	Provide training and onboarding support for clients and users in low-conversion regions
3.	Track open and click-through rates for reminder emails and texts to optimize outreach effectiveness
These actions will help us close the gap between product interest and completed orders, while empowering stakeholders with clearer visibility into performance trends.
